[*Qwiic Flex Glove Controller (SEN-14666)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14666)

The Qwiic Flex Glove Controller allows you to figure out just how bent all of your fingers are. This board uses an ADC to I2C to create an interface with SparkFun's Qwiic system, which means you won't have to do any soldering to figure out how bent your fingers are.

Library written by Andy England ([SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com)).
